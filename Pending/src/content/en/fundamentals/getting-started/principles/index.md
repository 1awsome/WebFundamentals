Google and AnswerLab conducted a [research study](https://www.google.com/think/multiscreen/whitepaper-sitedesign.html?utm_source=web-fundamentals&utm_term=chrome&utm_content=ux-landing&utm_campaign=web-fundamentals) to answer this question.

Mobile users are very goal-oriented. They expect to be able to get what they need, immediately, and on their own terms. 
</blockquote>

The study was held through 119 hour-long, in-person usability sessions with participants in the US. Participants were asked to perform key tasks across a diverse set of mobile sites. iOS and Android users were included, and users tested the sites on their own phones. For each site, participants were asked to voice their thoughts aloud as they completed conversion-focused tasks, like making a purchase or booking a reservation.

The study uncovered 25 mobile site design principles, grouped into five categories.
