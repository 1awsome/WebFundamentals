description: Download the sample code as a .zip file or clone it from GitHub

You can either download all the sample code to your computer:

[Download Zip file](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/push-notifications/archive/master.zip)

...or clone the GitHub repository from the command line:

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone git@github.com:GoogleChrome/push-notifications.git</code></pre></div>

This will create a **_push-notifications_** directory containing completed code for each step.

Create your own code in the directory named **_app_**. We'll refer to that throughout the codelab.
