## Optimizing content efficiency

The amount of data downloaded by apps continues to increase over time. To deliver great performance you must optimize data delivery as much as possible.

## Critical rendering path

Optimizing the critical rendering path refers to prioritizing the display of content that relates to the current user action.

## Understand low bandwidth and high latency

It's important to understand what your app or site feels like when connectivity is poor or unreliable, and build accordingly. A range of tools can help you.
