description: Strict Transport Security (STS) tells user agents they should always connect to your site via HTTPS. Coupling STS with secure cookies helps prevent accidental exposure of authentication and other site information.

<p class="intro">
At this point, you are ready to "lock in" the use of HTTPS.

First, use [Strict
Transport
Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to tell
clients that they should always connect to your server via HTTPS, even when
following an http:// reference. This defeats attacks such as [SSL
Stripping](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/), and also avoids the
round-trip cost of the 301 redirect we enabled in "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".

Turn on HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by setting the `Strict-Transport-Security`
header. [OWASP's HSTS page has links to
instructions](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
for various server software.

Most web servers offer a similar ability to add custom headers.

It is also important to make sure that clients never send cookies (such as for
authentication or site preferences) over HTTP. For example, if a user's
authentication cookie were to be exposed in plaintext, the security guarantee of
their entire session would be destroyed â€” even if you have done everything else
right!

Therefore, change your web application to always set the Secure flag on cookies
that it sets. [This OWASP page explains how to set the Secure
flag](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag) in several application
frameworks. Every application framework has some way to set the flag.
