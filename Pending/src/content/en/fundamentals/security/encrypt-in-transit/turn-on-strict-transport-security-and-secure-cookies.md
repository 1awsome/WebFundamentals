At this point, you are ready to "lock in" the use of HTTPS.

First, use [Strict
Transport
Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to tell
clients that they should always connect to your server via HTTPS, even when
following an http:// reference. This defeats attacks such as [SSL
Stripping](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/), and also avoids the
round-trip cost of the 301 redirect we enabled in "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".

Turn on HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by setting the `Strict-Transport-Security`
header. [OWASP's HSTS page has links to
instructions](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
for various server software.

Most web servers offer a similar ability to add custom headers.

It is also important to make sure that clients never send cookies (such as for
authentication or site preferences) over HTTP. For example, if a user's
authentication cookie were to be exposed in plaintext, the security guarantee of
their entire session would be destroyed â€” even if you have done everything else
right!

Therefore, change your web application to always set the Secure flag on cookies
that it sets. [This OWASP page explains how to set the Secure
flag](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag) in several application
frameworks. Every application framework has some way to set the flag.
