	With a JSON file and a link tag you can control how your app appears to the user in areas where they would expect to see apps (for example the mobile home screen), direct what the user can launch, and define its appearance at launch.

<div>
	<h3>Add to Home Screen</h3>
	Web app install banners give you the ability to let your users quickly and seamlessly add your web app to their home screen, making it easy to launch and return to your app.
