This article has given you a quick introduction to web app manifests. But there's more to learn.

* If you're using a web app manifest, you'll probably want set up an [app install banner](/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners) as well. 

* [A complete reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) to the web app manifest is available on the Mozilla Developer Network.

* If you want feature descriptions from the engineers who created web app manifests, you can read the [actual W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/).
