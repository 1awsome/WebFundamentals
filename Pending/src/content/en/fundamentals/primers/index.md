## Introduction to Service Worker

Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications&mdash;functionality that would normally require a native application&mdash;are coming to the web. Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features will rely on.

## Push and Notifications

Push messaging allows developers to engage users by providing timely and customized content outside the context of the web page. <b>Push</b> and <b>Notification</b> are different, but complementary, functions: a <b>push</b> is the action of the server supplying message information to a service worker; a <b>notification</b> is the action of the service worker sending the information to a user.
