  Push messaging allows developers to engage users by providing timely and customized content outside the context of the web page. <b>Push</b> and <b>Notification</b> are different, but complementary, functions: a <b>push</b> is the action of the server supplying message information to a service worker; a <b>notification</b> is the action of the service worker sending the information to a user.

The W3C manages the specifications for the [Push API](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/)
