# Instant-loading Offline-first (Progressive Web App Summit 2016) {: .page-title }

For most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we'll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app. We'll also break out of the app shell and look at approaches that better-suit traditional server-driven sites.
