ServiceWorker give you a variety of levers over the loading performance of your app. But HTTP already allowed you to speed up the loading of your app – and these two technologies stack, so you should know what you have at your disposal. With HTTP/2, things only get better. This talk will summarize, the past, the present and the future of protocol-level optimizations.

HTTPS is a must-have for progressive web apps. “But,” you say, “it&#x27;ll make my site slow! And it&#x27;s going to cost a ton! And does it really give me any security benefits?” In this talk, we debunk some common myths and fears about HTTPS, show you why it&#x27;s an essential feature for progressive web apps, and dispense some tips and tricks for getting a shiny green lock on your site.

## Instant-loading Offline-first (Progressive Web App Summit 2016)

For most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we&#x27;ll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app. We&#x27;ll also break out of the app shell and look at approaches that better-suit traditional server-driven sites.
