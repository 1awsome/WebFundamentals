In early 2015, the Chrome DevTools team has come to the realization that an expanding number of DevTools users aren&#x27;t simply developers, but prototypers and designers. Thus, we&#x27;ve refocused some of our efforts to ensure everyone can iterate quickly and efficiently on mobile-first, responsive page layouts. Tune in to learn about a few upcoming features that dramatically enhance your authoring workflow.

Looking around at web performance advice today can be overwhelming: everything comes with caveats, disclaimers, and sometimes one piece of advice can seem to actively contradict another. Phrases like “the DOM is slow” or “always use CSS animations!” make for great headlines, but the truth is often far more nuanced. In this session we&#x27;ll look at how to think holistically about performance, and how to prioritize optimization work that your users will notice and appreciate.

The Polymer library has come a long way. Since its 1.0 release at Google I/O and through the Polymer Summit this fall, Polymer has grown to be used by major companies on over a million web pages, and formed the foundation for some of the biggest recent Google web product launches. We’ll talk about the team’s vision and roadmap for the library and project overall, and show off some of the latest things we’ve been working on.

Web Bluetooth opens up low level communication with an expanding ecosystem of BLE devices such as toys, vending machines, museum exhibits, kiosks and more. The Physical Web makes discovering and connecting to these objects trivial for users. Together they expand the reach of the web to even more devices around users.
