# Google: What's next for WebRTC? {: .page-title }
Always the highlight of this event, Google provides nitty gritty details about what they are doing to progress WebRTC and their internal developments to help your application succeed. Serge Lachapelle and Justin Uberti also discuss the recently announced Alliance for Open Media, an effort to create royalty-free video codecs.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
