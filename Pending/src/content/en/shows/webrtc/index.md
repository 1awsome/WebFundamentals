In this demo, a video call (using the new Twilio video API) is held between a customer and a customer service agent. As the video call is happening IBM Watson Speech to Text service is transcribing the audio in real time. After the video call completes, Alchemy API is used to automatically determine which product the customer was giving feedback on and then determines the sentiment of that feedback. The corresponding product&#x27;s feedback score, a number between 0 and 100, fluctuates based on this …
