## Accessible Components: Labeling -- Polycasts #51

Today we&#x27;re wrapping up our series on accessibility by talking about labeling. While it&#x27;s important to make sure our elements have great keyboard support and semantics, we also need to make sure we can tell the user what our control is being used for. For example, if you were using a screen reader and you landed on a control that just said &quot;&quot;button&quot;&quot;, you wouldn&#x27;t really know what to do with it. Imagine instead that the button said &quot;&quot;Main Menu, button&quot;&quot;, that would be much nicer! The way we achi…

Continuing our series on Accessibility (a11y) today we&#x27;re talking about screen readers! Screen readers take the semantic information from your elements and produce an alternative, spoken UI, for user with visual impairments. But when we&#x27;re designing Web Components, we&#x27;re creating tags that have never existed before in the browser, meaning they don&#x27;t have built-in semantics. So what&#x27;s a screen reader supposed to do? Today on Polycasts we&#x27;ll look at how we can leverage ARIA to add semantics to our…

Accessibility (or A11y) is an extremely important topic for component authors because the components we build don&#x27;t have any built in semantics or keyboard support. That means It&#x27;s up to us to add it back in!

## Lazy loading data with app-route -- Polycasts #47

  <img class="attempt-right" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iAgSvlYavX0/mqdefault.jpg">
</a>

Lazy loading data and managing flash of unstyled content (FOUC) can be pretty tricky in a single page app. In today&#x27;s episode I&#x27;m going to tackle both of these topics. We&#x27;ll add a loading screen to our app that uses a spinner to indicate we&#x27;re waiting on our text content, then we&#x27;ll use a technique popularized by Medium where we base64 encode a low res version of our images (so we can display them quickly) and then transition to the higher res version once it&#x27;s had time to download.

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a set of rules to help mitigate and prevent attacks such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. On some platforms like Chrome Apps and Cordova it&#x27;s a *requirement* that your code comply with CSP, so what does that mean if you&#x27;re building a Polymer app? Today on the show we&#x27;ll look at how to use a little tool called Crisper to make sure your site is protected by CSP.

Observers are an awesome (though maybe under appreciated) feature of Polymer that let you react to property changes in your JavaScript. With observers you can watch a single property, subproperties, multiple properties, or even toss in a wildcard to monitor multiple subproperties all at the same time! Crazy awesome!

Web Animations are a new set of standards to unify CSS and JavaScript animations. With Web Animations you get the power of animating on the GPU while maintaining the control of working in JavaScript. But coordinating all these animations is no easy task and thankfully there’s an element for that—well a behavior actually but stay with me!

In this episode I’ll teach you how to use the neon-animation behaviors from the Polymer Element catalog to mixing slick animation behavior without the hassle o…

A big part of building for the multi-device web is responsive design. To make this easy on us, the Polymer team created the core-drawer-panel element, an application scaffold that&#x27;s responsive by default! In this video I&#x27;ll show you how to setup a page layout that leverages the core-drawer-panel, and we&#x27;ll also look at drawer panel&#x27;s fancier older brother, the core-scaffold.

The core-header-panel is a great next step after you&#x27;ve mastered some of the other elements like core-icon and core-toolbar. With core-header-panel we can control the scroll behavior of our page and combine it with other elements, like core-toolbar, to compose app-like UIs. In this video we&#x27;ll not only get a core-header-panel to show up, but we&#x27;ll also discuss the power of composition and how Web Components make it super easy.

The core-toolbar element is a great place to start with Web Components because it&#x27;s very easy to get up and running. With the core-toolbar you can layout titles, buttons, and various other controls for your application. In this video we&#x27;ll cover getting your first core-toolbar up on screen, and configuring it with a handful of useful options.
