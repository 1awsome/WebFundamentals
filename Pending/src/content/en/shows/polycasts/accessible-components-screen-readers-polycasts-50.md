Continuing our series on Accessibility (a11y) today we&#x27;re talking about screen readers! Screen readers take the semantic information from your elements and produce an alternative, spoken UI, for user with visual impairments. But when we&#x27;re designing Web Components, we&#x27;re creating tags that have never existed before in the browser, meaning they don&#x27;t have built-in semantics. So what&#x27;s a screen reader supposed to do? Today on Polycasts we&#x27;ll look at how we can leverage ARIA to add semantics to our elements to make sure they&#x27;re properly announced and all of our users can interact with them.

Screen Readers:

Although we didn&#x27;t mention it Windows also includes the Narrator screen reader (Win + Enter to activate)
