Web Animations is a new animation model designed by multiple browser vendors and is now shipping in Blink. Chrome shipped CSS Animations and CSS Transitions running on top of Web Animations at the end of 2013. New Web Animation capabilities are now exposed in JS and give web developers powerful creative control of animations from JS but without jank. The Web Animations engine is one of the core features used by the Polymer project. This session explains the model, the new APIs, how to use them and shows real world examples of how to integrate them into your sites now.
