# V8, modern JavaScript, and beyond - Google I/O 2016 {: .page-title }

Join Seth Thompson as he talks about V8, modern JavaScript, and beyond.

JavaScript powers the modern web and countless servers running Node.js. Chrome's V8 engine is faster than ever at running JavaScript code and now includes powerful new ES2015 features to give developers more control over how they write their apps. Listen to Seth Thompson talk about the latest speed advances V8 has made in compiling and running real-world code and how those performance improvements scale to large JavaScript frameworks running on a wide variety of devices. Finally, hear about the future of fast code in the browser with WebAssembly: a new cross-browser, plugin-free, low-level runtime for executing C/C++ code on the web.
