Join Seth Thompson as he talks about V8, modern JavaScript, and beyond.

JavaScript powers the modern web and countless servers running Node.js. Chrome&#x27;s V8 engine is faster than ever at running JavaScript code and now includes powerful new ES2015 features to give developers more control over how they write their apps. Listen to Seth Thompson talk about the latest speed advances V8 has made in compiling and running real-world code and how those performance improvements scale to large JavaScript …

Alex Russell on AMP + Progressive Web Apps: Start fast, stay engaged. 

AMP delivers outstanding page-load performance for users browsing content on the mobile web, which is hugely important on limited or flaky networks. AMP gets content in front of users fast.

Progressive Web Apps deliver reliable performance for re-visits to sites thanks to Service Workers and the App Shell architecture. This technique allows sites to deliver rich experiences without worrying about networks.

Until now, howev…

Web components are the new shiny thing on the web, but what makes a good web component? How do you design a useful API that works for all of your users and all of their browsers? How do you make it render quickly and how do you teach people how to use it? After a year of working on the Polymer Elements, I&#x27;ve made sure to make all the possible mistakes so that you don&#x27;t have to. This talk is about the things I&#x27;ve learned from that.

Jake Archibald on Instant Loading: Building offline-first Progressive Web Apps 

For most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we&#x27;ll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app, and this won&#x27;t involve rebuilding from scratch; it&#x27;ll be done in small iterations, with each step improving the user experience whether they&#x27;re offline, online, or anything in between.

Does the “Forgot password” link on your site receive more clicks than you&#x27;d like? Creating, remembering and typing passwords is a real hassle for users, especially on mobile screens. As a result, users get stuck on the sign-in screen and have established a habit to reuse the same passwords across different sites, which of course entails a significant security risk.
