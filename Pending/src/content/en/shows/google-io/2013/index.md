Ilya Grigorik, Stephen Konig 

WebP is a new, open-source image format which provides lossy and lossless compression of images with significant byte savings: 30-80% smaller image files when compared to jpeg and png! In this session we will cover the latest features, news, and future roadmap of the WebP format. We will  dive into a few hands-on case studies and recount how large sites and applications deployed WebP, the challenges they faced in the process, and the benefits they saw and measured …

## Google I/O 2013 - Feature Detection in the Real World

Pamela Fox, Paul Irish 

In an ideal world, we would always use feature detection to decide what features to serve our users. Unfortunately, in the real world, there are practical problems with that approach, especially when facing users on mobile devices where you need to evaluate their runtime capabilities while you&#x27;re serving assets.
In this talk, I&#x27;ll introduce the ideas and tools behind feature detection and then discuss our experiences with detecting the edge of the web at Coursera.

Dan Heberden, Paul Irish 

Building web applications often means utilizing other libraries, frameworks, and plugins. Using a package manager to mange this greatly improves your productivity, enhances the speed and security of your application, and makes it much easier to stay up to date. Forget tracking new releases of libraries on blogs/Twitter, manually downloading dependent scripts, and managing the files and folders of libraries you use. With package management, keeping your dependencies upd…

Since 2011, NativeClient (NaCl) has been a feature of Chrome available through the Chrome Web Store.

PNaCl is the next exciting step for this technology.  It continues Native Client&#x27;s compatibility with developers&#x27; existing codebases and near native-code performance, but brings this to the open web in a truly portable fashion.  The technology is built around the open source LLVM compiler infrastructure. This technology enables application developers to build both web and Chrome Web…

With the Google Drive SDK, developers can integrate custom &quot;&quot;Create&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Open With&quot;&quot; menus within the Google Drive interface and reach tens of millions of users. Using Apps Script API in conjunction with the Google Drive SDK, developers can take advantage of the unique capabilities of Apps Script while also developing entirely on the Google Cloud! We will also demonstrate how you can get programmatic access to files and folders in Drive via Apps Script.

This session builds on technologies and concepts discussed in a previous session, &quot;&quot;Web Components: a tectonic shift for web development&quot;&quot;. This year web development gets a whole lot better thanks to the incredible power of Web Components. Our goal in this session is to show you how to use polyfills to help you realize tomorrow&#x27;s web platform today. As browsers implement these new specifications, that shim layer gets smaller, better, and faster over time. We&#x27;ll …

Chrome implements fast, powerful webpage rendering by using the graphics hardware (GPU). But powerful GPU rendering introduces a new suite of issues that web developers need to understand. For example, how often is the texture cache invalidated? How can using translate-z cause GPU performance issues? How do hidden divs affect the GPU compositing process? 

Attendees will walk away with a clear understanding of the GPU compositor in Chrome and knowledge of how their de…
