Kasper Lund, Lars Bak 

A fundamental necessity for innovation within web apps is fast execution speed. This talk will take a deep dive into the machine rooms of both V8 and the Dart VM and explain some of the reasons why a new execution engine is needed for taking the web platform to the next level. Please join us to hear about how programming languages impact the underlying virtual machines, complexity, on-the-fly code generation, and predictable performance.
