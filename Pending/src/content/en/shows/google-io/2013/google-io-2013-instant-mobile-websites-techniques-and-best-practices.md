Users expect a fast and optimized experience regardless of whether they&#x27;re on a mobile or desktop browser. However, delivering a fast mobile experience requires careful consideration and engineering: you need to optimize your network access, you need to prioritize critical assets to deliver the best visual rendering performance, and you need to adapt your pages to the capabilities of the device (such as smaller viewport, touch, high-resolution screens, etc.). In this session we will take a deep technical dive into the criteria that affect the performance of your sites on mobile browsers, and discuss how you can optimize your site to deliver the best experience to your users.
