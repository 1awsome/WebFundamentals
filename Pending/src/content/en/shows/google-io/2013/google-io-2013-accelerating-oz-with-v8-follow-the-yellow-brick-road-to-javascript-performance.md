Take advantage of the lessons learned by the developers of Find Your Way to Oz. Getting that last ounce of performance from your application takes careful optimization that can only be done with an understanding of the runtime environment. Learn how to dig into V8 and surface the important signals that you need to effectively optimize your program. Use these signals to find where small code changes can have large impacts on performance!
