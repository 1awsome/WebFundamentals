As the complexity of the web apps you build keeps moving, so do the Chrome DevTools.  We&#x27;ll give you the latest update on your favorite companion; explore new features like emulating mobile devices, remote debugging, Canvas and WebGL profiling, Sass preprocessor support, developing completely within Chrome using the new Workspaces support, and 20 other features that are brand-new to you and will hugely improve your development. Also, learn how to profile and improve your #1 enemy to scrolling performance: paint. Emulate mobile devices within Chrome DevTools with simulated touch events and geolocation data. You&#x27;ll walk out of the session with a huge advantage in productivity, speed, and precision when developing, debugging, and improving your web applications.
