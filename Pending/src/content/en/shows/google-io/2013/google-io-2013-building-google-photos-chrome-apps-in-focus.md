&quot;James Hawkins, Joe Marini 

The fast pace of innovation on the Chrome platform calls to mind the Wild West, but developing a product on this frontier is easier than it seems. In this session, the lead engineer of the Google+ Photos Chrome application will provide an anecdotal account of what it takes to ship a real-world Chrome app. Take advantage of lessons learned, including how to get the changes you need into the platform. In addition, we will highlight several new APIs in Chrome packaged apps that allow your application to interact with and drive real-world devices. Learn how we built Google+ Photos to look and act like a native application and learn how to do the same with your Chrome app.
