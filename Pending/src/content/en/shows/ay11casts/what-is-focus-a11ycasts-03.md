Focus is one of the main pillars of accessibility, but it&#x27;s also an area that many developers are a little fuzzy on.

Here&#x27;s a good quote from Web AIM to help explain it: &quot;&quot;When an item has keyboard &#x27;focus&#x27;, it can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard.&quot;&quot; In other words, if an element is currently focused, and you press a key on your keyboard, that keyboard event will be directed at that element. http://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#intro

Users can change the currently focused element by pressing either the Tab or Shift-Tab keys. The order that elements receive focus is known as the &quot;&quot;Tab Order&quot;&quot;. Making sure you have a consistent, logical tab order is extremely important, especially for users who rely on the keyboard as their primary means of navigating a page.

In this episode we&#x27;ll show off what it means for elements to be implicitly focusable, and correct some common mistakes relating to mixed up tab orders.
