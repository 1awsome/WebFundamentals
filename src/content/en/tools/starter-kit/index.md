<span style="font-size:x-large">
Your starting point for building great multi-device web experiences
</span>


Start your project with the Web Starter Kit and ensure you're following the
[Web Fundamentals](/web/fundamentals/) guidelines out of the box.

## What is Web Starter Kit?

Web Starter Kit is an easy way to start a new project. It comes
with all the files you could need to start a new web project including
a build process, boilerplate HTML and styles.

A responsive layout is included with the kit that adapts to fit the device
your user is viewing it on. This helps you hit the ground running with an
experience that looks good everywhere.

## Why use Web Starter Kit?

Web Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of
the box and we actively work on delivering the best 
[PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
score and frame-rate possible.

We hope that you tailor Web Starter Kit by deleting anything that you don't
want or need. It's a starting point - nothing more.
