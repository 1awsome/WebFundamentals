## Debug JavaScript

When your JavaScript is buggy, you can set breakpoints to pause execution
of your code, and then use DevTools' debugger to step through your code
one statement at a time. You can also use the Watch Variables feature to
monitor the value of specific variables over time.

## Improve readability

Many sites use minification to reduce the network payload of their
JavaScript files at the expense of readability. DevTools has a
pretty-print utility that reformats minified code into a more readable
format.

## Run snippets of JavaScript from any page

Many developers use bookmarklets to run small snippets of utility code from
any page. Another approach is Snippets, which you author and run from within
DevTools.
