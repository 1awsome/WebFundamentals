Polymer and Web Components are exciting, but developers are not always sure how to connect the dots to get a full blown, production-ready app. Where should you store your data? How do you handle user authentication? What are the patterns that make up a good Polymer app? In this session Rob answers these questions, and guides you through the process of building an awesome offline-first Progressive webapp using Polymer Starter Kit, the Platinum elements, and Firebase.
