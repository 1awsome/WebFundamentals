In this episode, Matt and Addy talk about instant loading web apps with an Application Shell architecture. The Application Shell architecture encourages caching your application shell (the User Interface) so it works offline and populate its content using JavaScript. On repeat visits, this allows you to get meaningful pixels on the screen really fast without the network, even if your content eventually comes from there. This comes with significant performance gains.
