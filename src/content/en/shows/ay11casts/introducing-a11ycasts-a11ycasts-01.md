Hey folks! Accessibility is a topic very near and dear to my heart. And as I&#x27;ve spent the past year speaking about it I&#x27;ve realized that so many developers WANT to build accessible apps, but they&#x27;re just not sure how to go about it. To help teach those fundamentals I thought it would be great to have a series dedicated entirely to the art of accessibility. Meet A11ycasts!

A11ycasts is short for AccessibilityCasts (a11y is a common shortening of the term accessibility because there are 11 letters in between the &quot;&quot;A&quot;&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Y&quot;&quot;). The goal of A11ycasts is to teach developers how accessibility works all the way down at the platform level, while also demonstrating real world accessibility problems and solutions to fix them.

Thanks and enjoy the show!  -- Rob
