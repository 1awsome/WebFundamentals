Keyboard focus is crucially important for both motor impaired users, and visually impaired users relying on a screen reader. One common UI mistake is to leave elements in the DOM that are offscreen but still contain focusable children. A responsive side nav is a classic example.

So in today&#x27;s episode we&#x27;ll look at how we can solve this common gotcha with a new proposed HTML attribute: inert! Using the inert attribute you can take an entire tree of elements out of the tab order and the accessibility tree. It&#x27;s an awesome feature that&#x27;s totally missing from the web platform today, but we&#x27;re working to change that!

In the upcoming episodes we&#x27;ll take a step back and explore the underlying concepts around focus and how it works in the platform, but if you&#x27;re eager to play around with inert today you can find the polyfill up on GitHub. Enjoy!
