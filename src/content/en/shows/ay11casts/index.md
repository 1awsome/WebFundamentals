Focus is one of the main pillars of accessibility, but it&#x27;s also an area that many developers are a little fuzzy on.

Here&#x27;s a good quote from Web AIM to help explain it: &quot;&quot;When an item has keyboard &#x27;focus&#x27;, it can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard.&quot;&quot; In other words, if an element is currently focused, and you press a key on your keyboard, that keyboard event will be directed at that element. http://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#intro

Users can change the currently focused element…

Hey folks! Accessibility is a topic very near and dear to my heart. And as I&#x27;ve spent the past year speaking about it I&#x27;ve realized that so many developers WANT to build accessible apps, but they&#x27;re just not sure how to go about it. To help teach those fundamentals I thought it would be great to have a series dedicated entirely to the art of accessibility. Meet A11ycasts!

A11ycasts is short for AccessibilityCasts (a11y is a common shortening of the term accessibility because there are 11 letter…
