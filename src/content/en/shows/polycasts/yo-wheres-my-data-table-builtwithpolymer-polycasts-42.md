A lot of folks have been asking when is the Polymer team going to build a date picker or a data table? Today on the show I want to highlight some of the awesome community built elements that meet these needs. paper-date-picker by Ben Davis is a super slick, Material design, responsive date picker that works in Polymer 1.0 apps. And the vaadin-grid is a full featured data table with a fancy pants expense manager demo. Got a cool element you&#x27;ve built? Tell us about it on Twitter with #builtwithpolymer!
