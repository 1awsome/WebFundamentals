Content Security Policy (CSP) is a set of rules to help mitigate and prevent attacks such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. On some platforms like Chrome Apps and Cordova it&#x27;s a *requirement* that your code comply with CSP, so what does that mean if you&#x27;re building a Polymer app? Today on the show we&#x27;ll look at how to use a little tool called Crisper to make sure your site is protected by CSP.
