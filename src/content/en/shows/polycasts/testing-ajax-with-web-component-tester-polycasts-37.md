Elements that need to get data from a backend service can be tricky to test. Do you need to startup your own test server just to verify an element does what it&#x27;s supposed to? Is that even a good idea? Today on Polycasts I&#x27;ll show you have to use Web Component Tester and a library called Sinon.js to mock your back end and speed up your unit tests. By mocking your backend you can verify that your element&#x27;s work in isolation, which is a crucial step to having good overall test coverage of your app.
