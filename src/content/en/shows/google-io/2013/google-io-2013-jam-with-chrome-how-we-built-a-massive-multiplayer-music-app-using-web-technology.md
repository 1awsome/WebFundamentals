Built by the Creative Labs team in London, Jam with Chrome was a hugely successful Chrome experiment that allowed users to form a band from nearly anywhere in the world and &quot;&quot;Jam&quot;&quot; like stars in near real-time. We will show you how we built Jam with Chrome using the latest web technologies and give you practical advice and guidance on how you can do the same. We will focus on the Real time WebSockets component, the session management system, and the music engine made using the Web Audio API--come learn how to &quot;&quot;Jam.&quot;&quot;
