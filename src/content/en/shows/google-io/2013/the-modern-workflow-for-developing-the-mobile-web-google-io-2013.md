Building for today&#x27;s mobile web, getting 60fps across all target devices, while still delivering a fantastic user experience is a huge challenge. We&#x27;ll dive into all the tools for development, testing, and performance evaluation of mobile webapps. Understand how best to develop with immediate feedback from the mobile devices you&#x27;re targetting, scale up complexity to avoid hard performance decisions later. We&#x27;ll also review all the possibilities of device testing locally and in the cloud.
In this session we&#x27;ll debut improved remote debugging with Chrome for Android and the Chrome DevTools. You can now do local tunneling for improved local development.
You&#x27;ll walk away from the session with a solid overview of the landscape of mobile web tooling and feel confident returning to your projects.
