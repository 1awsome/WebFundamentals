It&#x27;s tempting to view CSS optimization as a dark art, for initiates only.  This session will focus on identifying and resolving slow renders, with an emphasis on layout and paint times.  We&#x27;ll use Chrome DevTools to find, benchmark, and debug slowness in the render-side of an application.  Uncovering a number of sluggish culprits, we&#x27;ll explore where the time is spent and dig into profiling data from Chrome&#x27;s internals. You&#x27;ll walk away with a better understanding of how to use your time wisely while making your application scream with speed, and smart workarounds that address common CSS performance problems.
