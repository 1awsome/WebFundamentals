Pamela Fox, Paul Irish 

In an ideal world, we would always use feature detection to decide what features to serve our users. Unfortunately, in the real world, there are practical problems with that approach, especially when facing users on mobile devices where you need to evaluate their runtime capabilities while you&#x27;re serving assets.
In this talk, I&#x27;ll introduce the ideas and tools behind feature detection and then discuss our experiences with detecting the edge of the web at Coursera.
