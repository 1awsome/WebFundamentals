Google Drive aims to deliver your apps to Google Drive users where and when they need to find them inside Google Drive or on a mobile device. This talk will describe the compelling reasons why your app should integrate with Google Drive, and the ways in which your app can reach as many customers as possible. We will run through how your app will appear to users, and the technical details behind putting it there.
