Almost every new mobile device today ships with a high DPI screen. That trend has started branching out to laptops, and itâs only a matter of time until every device we use is high DPI. In this talk weâll dive into what high DPI means and how you can optimize your sites so they look great in any form factor.  Youâll learn 1) how different âpixelsâ affect layout and how to achieve the layout you want, 2) how layouts are affected by different display densities, and 3) how different image formats can be used to provide the best experience for users ensuring that your site looks great on any device.  Youâll walk away knowing how to use responsive techniques to build sites that shine, and also how you can quickly update your existing sites to look beautiful, both today and in the future.
