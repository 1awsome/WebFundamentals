According to Cisco, video data will be 55 percent of all consumer Internet traffic by 2016. With that much data traversing networks, efficient video compression will be more important than ever, especially on mobile networks. We are very excited about the new VP9 codec, which delivers better video quality at lower data rates than competing technologies. Furthermore, VP9 was developed entirely in the open as a royalty-free technology. In this session you will learn how VP9 performs against H.264 and other other codecs in quality and decoding speed, how to create WebM videos with VP9 and the new Opus audio codec, and how to deploy VP9 content to Chrome users in HTML5 video.
