Dan Beam, Evan Stade 

Ever try buying something on the mobile web? Combine a mess of form fields and a soft keyboard and it&#x27;s more frustrating than it needs to be. How many customers don&#x27;t buy things from you because doing so is just too much work?  requestAutocomplete() is an aspiring web standard that will allow users to bypass pages of form fields with an imperative API for requesting details the browser knows. In this session we&#x27;ll highlight how to enhance your site with requestAutocomplete(), how to quickly implement the feature, and what to consider when optimizing the UX of your ecommerce experience.
