Nat Duca, Tom Wiltzius 

Animations and scrolling at 60FPS: difficult! Let&#x27;s talk about rendering performance by way of a couple case studies. We&#x27;ll cover the basic challenge of smooth animation, approaches to finding the bottleneck in your application using Dev Tools, and methods to cope with some common pitfalls. Topics include Dev Tools rendering features, subtleties of CSS animation, common cases that kill scrolling performance, and a peak into the hardware acceleration model that underpins Chrome&#x27;s graphics pipeline.
