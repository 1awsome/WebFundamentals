We launched [Web **Fundamentals**](/web/fundamentals/) two years ago to help
ensure that developers had the latest guidance on how to build great sites and 
apps on the web for desktop and 
[mobile](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html).

Much has [changed on the web](/web/progressive-web-apps/) since then, and 
[we](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev) are pleased to announce a new chapter in 
our work with developers. 

We've significantly updated [Web **Fundamentals**](/web/fundamentals/) to make 
it clearer to navigate, and to better support the Progressive Web Apps story 
we've:

* Launched a brand new [Accessibility section](/web/fundamentals/accessibility) 
  covering the fundamentals of focus, semantics, and ARIA.
* Refined [Web **Tools**](http://developers.google.com/web/tools) - so you can 
  find all the latest and greatest information about Chrome Dev Tools and 
  libraries such as [SW-Precache](/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/#service-worker-precache) 
  and [SW-toolbox](/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/#service-worker-toolbox)
* Updated our [Progressive Web Apps](http://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) 
  guidance including an [Offline cookbook](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/), 
  a [Service Worker life-cycle](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/service-worker/lifecycle) guide,
  an introduction to [App Shell](/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell) and a
  getting started guide for [Shadow DOM](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/shadowdom) 
  and [Web Push](/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/)
* Added a new [Instant and Reliable Loading](/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/) 
  section, and updated our guidance on [hardware integrations](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/) 
  with guidance on using [cameras](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/capturing-images/) 
  and [microphones](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/recording-audio/), 
  as well as created a new [UX Basics](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/ux-basics/)
  guide

We think this update will make it easier to find the tools and guidance that you 
need for building on the web across all devices!

As we create and update [developers.google.com/web](/web/)
we also have to think about the future of our other resources. Many of you will 
know that our team created and, through the community, supported the growth of
HTML5Rocks but over the last two years it has seen no updates. We've already 
migrated [updates.html5rocks.com](https://updates.html5rocks.com) to 
[Web **Updates**](/web/updates) and we are in the process of migrating some 
additional material from HTML5rocks to Web**Fundamentals**. We've even recently 
ensured that all content on HTML5rocks over https, but we are not planning on 
adding any new content and we will ensure that HTML5Rocks will continue serving 
existing content.

We'd like to thank our 
[contributors](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/graphs/contributors) 
and the web developer community for feedback, bug reports, and content 
contributed to both the HTML5Rocks and Web **Fundamentals**. We couldn't have done 
it without your help!.
