## Give Search Engines Your Site Structure {: .page-title }

{% include "_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}

How your website appears in search results is an important aspect of multi-device site design. This guide helps you learn to optimize your website for search engines based on its URL structure.


## TL;DR
- Determine the URL structure of your webpage
- Responsive design is most recommended
- Use <code>rel='canonical'</code> + <code>rel='alternate'</code> for separate desktop/mobile sites
- Use <code>Vary HTTP</code> header for a single URL dynamically serving separate desktop/mobile HTMLs


Are you planning to build your webpage responsive? Is there a mobile specific
version with a separate URL? Are you serving both desktop version and mobile
version from the same URL? You might be able to do a better job optimizing your
website for search engines.

### Determine URL structure of your webpage
There are several ways to serve content to different devices. The three most
common methods are:

1. **Responsive Web Design:** serves the same HTML for one URL and uses CSS
media queries to determine how the content is rendered on the client side.  
ex) Desktop and Mobile: http://www.example.com/
1. **Separate mobile site:** redirects users to a different URL depending on the
user-agent.  
ex) Desktop: http://www.example.com/ Mobile: http://m.example.com/
1. **Dynamic serving:** serves different HTML for one URL depending on the user-
agent.  
ex) Desktop and Mobile: http://www.example.com/

The best approach we recommend is to use responsive web design, but a lot of
websites already serve mobile specific version. Some serves mobile version using
the same URL as desktop.
  
Determine which URL structure suits your webpage. Then try respective best
practices to optimize it for search engines.

### Responsive Web Design is recommended
If you are planning to make your website responsive, you are already good. The
benefit of making your website responsive is:

* User friendly for sharing
* Quicker page load without redirects
* Single point of URL for search results

<img src="imgs/responsive-2x.png" srcset="imgs/responsive.png 1x, imgs/responsive-2x.png 2x" >

By making it responsive:

* Easier for users to access or share your webpage
* No need to redirect users depending on user agent so it is faster
* Maintenance cost is lower for both website and crawlers

### Use `link[rel=canonical]` and `link[rel=alternate]` when serving from separate URLs
Serving similar contents on a desktop version and a mobile version at different
URLs may cause confusion for both users and search engines because it's not
obvious for viewers that they are intended to be identical. You should indicate:

* Contents of those 2 URLs are identical
* Which is mobile version
* Which is desktop (canonical) version

This information can help search engines better index content and ensure users
find what they're looking for in a format that works for their device.

#### Use `link[rel=alternate]` for desktop version
On desktop page, indicate that there's a mobile version on a different URL by
adding `link` tag with `rel="alternate"` pointing to mobile version URL with
`href`. By adding `media` attribute with value of `"only screen and (max-width:
640px)"` will help search engines understand that this is explicitly targeting
small screens.

[http://www.example.com/](http://www.example.com/) HTML


    <title>...</title>
    <link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="http://m.example.com/">
    

#### Use `link[rel=canonical]` for mobile version
On mobile specific pages, indicate that there's a desktop (canonical) version at
a different URL by adding `link` tag with `rel="canonical"` pointing to desktop
version URL with `href`.

[http://m.example.com/](http://m.example.com/) HTML


    <title>...</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/">
    
  
<img src="imgs/different_url-2x.png" srcset="imgs/different_url.png 1x, imgs/different_url-2x.png 2x" >

### Use `Vary HTTP` header for device oriented serving site
Serving different HTML based on device type can reduce unnecessary redirects,
serves optimized HTML, provides single URL for search engines, but it also has
several disadvantages:

* There may be intermediate proxies between user's browsers and the server.
Unless the proxy knows the content varies depending on user agent, it may serve
unexpected results.
* Changing contents depending on user agent has a risk to be considered as
[cloaking](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355), a violation of
Googleâ€™s Webmaster Guidelines.

By letting search engines know that the content varies depending on user agent,
they can optimize search results for the user agent that is sending queries.

#### Use `Vary HTTP` header
In order to indicate that the URL serves different HTML depending on user agent,
provide `Vary: User-Agent` in HTTP header.

[http://www.example.com/](http://www.example.com/) HTTP Header


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html
    Vary: User-Agent
    Content-Length: 5710
    

<img src="imgs/same_url-2x.png" srcset="imgs/same_url.png 1x, imgs/same_url-2x.png 2x" >

By providing `Vary: User-Agent` header, search engines and proxies understand
the transferred content may vary depending on user agent. This allows search
index to treat desktop version and mobile version separately, intermediate
proxies to cache those contents gracefully.

## Control Crawling and Indexing from Search Engines {: .page-title }

{% include "_shared/contributors/agektmr.html" %}

Being listed properly on search engines is critical to delivering your website to the world, but poor configuration may cause unexpected content to be included in the results. Learn how crawlers work and how they index your website in order to avoid such problems.


Sharing information to the world has no better place than the web. Once you publish a document to the web, it will be immediately available to the rest of the world. The page will be visible to anyone as long as they know the URL and that's where search engines come in. Once search engines learn about your website, your documents will be searchable and accessible from people all around the world.  

However, there are some cases where you don't want people to find those documents even though you want to put them on the web. For example, a blog's admin page is something only limited people should have access to. There's nothing beneficial for you to let people search those pages through search engines.  

In this document, you will learn how to inform search engines that you want certain pages not appear in the search results.  


### Understand the difference between "crawl" and "index"
Before learning how to control search results, understanding how search engines interact with your webpage is important. From your site's point of view, there are roughly 2 things search engines do to your site: "crawling" and "indexing".  

"Crawling" is when a search engine bot accesses your webpage and fetches it and analyses its content. The content will be stored in the search engine's database and may be used for populating search result details, ranking and discovering new pages by following links.  

"Indexing" is when a search engine stores a website's URL and any associated information to their database so it will be ready to be served as a search result.  

<!-- TODO: Verify note type! -->
Note: Many people confuses crawling and indexing. Prohibiting crawling doesn't mean the page won't show up in the search results. For example, when a third party website has a link to one of your webpages which is blocked from crawling, the page may still be listed in search results (In that case, the result won't have detailed description).

### Control search bots' crawling
You can actually control how well-behaved crawlers access your webpage using a text file called robots.txt. (Not all crawlers necessarily respect robots.txt. Imagine that anyone can create their own stray crawlers.)  

#### How to use robots.txt
Robots.txt is a simple text file describing how you want search bots to crawl your site.

Place `robots.txt` at the root directory of your website's host: If your site's host is `http://pages.example.com/`, then the `robots.txt` file should be located at `http://pages.example.com/robots.txt`. If the domain has different schema, subdomains or other ports, they will be considered as different hosts and you should have `robots.txt` for each of their root directories.  

Here's a quick example:  

**http://pages.example.com/robots.txt**

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /
    

This indicates that you want to disallow all kind of bots to crawl your entire website.  

**http://pages.example.com/robots.txt**

    User-agent: Googlebot
    Disallow: /nogooglebot/
    

You can specify the behavior per bots (user agents) by indicating a user-agent name after `User-agent:`. In the above case, you are disallowing user agent called `Googlebot` to crawl `/nogooglebot/` and all contents below the directory.  

You can learn how to create robots.txt further on relevant search engines' help pages:  

* [Google](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_txt)
* [Bing](http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/how-to-create-a-robots-txt-file-cb7c31ec)
* [Yandex](https://help.yandex.com/webmaster/controlling-robot/robots-txt.xml)
^

<!-- TODO: Verify note type! -->
Note: <code>robots.txt</code> is only required <b>if</b> you want to control the way your site is crawled. Do not to return response code 500 for the url: <code>/robots.txt</code>. That will terminate all subsequent crawls for the entire host resulting in empty search result details.

#### Test robots.txt
Depending on which crawlers your robots.txt is targeting at, search engine providers may provide a tool to test robots.txt. Taking Google as an example, there's a validator in [Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/robots-testing-tool). Use it to test by yourself if your robots.txt works as expected.  

<img src="imgs/robots-txt-validator.png" srcset="imgs/robots-txt-validator-2x.png 2x, imgs/robots-txt-validator.png 1x">

Yandex also provides [a similar tool](https://webmaster.yandex.com/robots.xml).  

### Control search indexing
If you don't want your webpage to show up in the search results, robots.txt isn't the right solution. You need to allow those pages to be crawled, and explicitly indicate that you don't want them to be indexed. There are two solutions:  

#### Use robots meta tags
In order to indicate you don't want an HTML page to be indexed, insert a specific kind of `meta` tag. By setting its attributes as `name="robots"` and `content="noindex"`, you can indicate that you don't want any search engines to index the page.  


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html><head>
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
    

By changing the value of the `name` attribute to a specific user agent name, you can narrow the scope. For example, `name="googlebot"` indicates that you don't want Googlebot to index the page (case insensitive).  


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html><head>
    <meta name="googlebot" content="noindex" />

* [Yandex](https://help.yandex.com/webmaster/controlling-robot/html.xml)

#### X-Robots-Tag
In order to indicate you don't want other resources than HTML such as images, stylesheets or script files, to be indexed, add `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` in HTTP header.  


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-Robots-Tag: noindex
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    

If you want to narrow the scope to a specific user agent, insert user agent name before `noindex`.  


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-Robots-Tag: googlebot: noindex
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

^

<!-- TODO: Verify note type! -->
Note: If you disallow crawls using robots.txt, Â search bots still may index those pages without knowing that you don't want those pages to be indexed. This can happen because:<ul><li>Search bots may find your webpages by following links from other websites.</li><li>Search engines can't detect <code>noindex</code> because it can't crawl.</li></ul>

Don't expect robots.txt to control search indexes.

### Solution examples by type of contents
What are the best solutions to control crawling and indexing? Let's have a look at example solutions depending on the types of pages.  

#### Fully accessible and searchable from anyone
Pages you want anyone to access and expect as much traffic as possible. Most of pages on the web are usually of this type.  

##### Solutions

* No robots.txt required.
* No robots meta tags required.

#### Limited access from people who know the URL
Non-confidential pages you want only limited people who know the URL to access. Examples are:  

* Login page for a blog admin console
* Private content shared by passing a URL for novice internet users

##### Solutions
In this type, you don't want search engines to index those pages.  

* No robots.txt required.
* Use `noindex` meta tags for HTML pages.
* Use `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` for non HTML resources (images, pdf, etc).

Note: Wondering if you should prohibit crawling JavaScript and Stylesheet files? <a href='http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html' target='_blank'>Google now try its best to understand them</a> to find contents available through modern technologies such as AJAX. You should definitely allow crawlers to crawl it.

#### Restricted access from authorized people
Confidential pages you want only those who have right permissions can access. In this case, even if someone finds the URL, the server refuses to present the result without a proper credential. For example:  

* Privately shared content on a social network
* Enterprise expense system

##### Solutions
In this type of pages, you don't want search engines to crawl nor index them.  

* Return response code 401 "Unauthorised" for an access without a proper credential (or redirect the user to a login page)
* Do not use robots.txt to disallow crawling these pages. Otherwise 401 can't be detected.

The restriction mechanism here can be IP address, Cookie, Basic Auth, OAuth, etc. How to implement such authentication / authorization depends on your infrastructure and is out of this article's scope.  

### Request a page removal to search engines if needed
There are cases where you want to remove a search result in the situations such as:  

* The page no longer exists
* The page was accidentally indexed that includes confidential information


Major search engines provide a way to send a request to remove such pages. The process usually takes following:  

1. Make sure the page you will request to remove:
    * is already removed and returns 404.
    * has a proper configuration not to index (ex: noindex)

1. Go to the request page on respective search engines (Google and Bing require you to register and validate ownership of your website.)
1. Send a request.
