<img src="https://placehold.it/300x200" class="attempt-right">

Web applications continue to grow in their scope, ambition, and functionality. The relentless march toward a richer web is driving another trend: the amount of data downloaded by each application increases at a steady pace. To deliver great performance we need to optimize delivery of each and every byte.
