# Security {: .page-title }

The web's security model is rooted in the
[_same origin policy_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy). Code
from `https://mybank.com` should only have access to `https://mybank.com`'s
data, and `https://evil.example.com` should certainly never be allowed access.
Each origin is kept isolated from the rest of the web, giving developers a safe
sandbox in which to build and play. In theory, this is brilliant. In practice,
attackers have found clever ways to subvert the system.

## Encrypt in Transit

Always protect your websites with HTTPS, even if they donâ€™t handle sensitive communications. HTTPS provides critical security and data integrity both for your websites and for the people that entrust your websites with their personal information.

## Prevent Mixed Content

This section discusses some tools that are available to help with the sometimes time-consuming process of finding and fixing mixed content. Mixed content occurs when initial HTML is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection, but other resources are loaded over an insecure HTTP connection.
