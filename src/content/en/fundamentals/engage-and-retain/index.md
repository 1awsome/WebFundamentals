## Push Notifications

Push notifications are one of the most valuable capabilities of native apps, and this capability is now available on the web. To get the most out of them, notifications need to be timely, precise, and relevant.

## Improve User Experiences with a Web App Manifest

The web app manifest is a JSON file that gives you the ability to control how your web app or site appears to the user in areas where they would expect to see native apps (for example, a device's home screen), direct what the user can launch, and define its appearance at launch.

## Using App Install Banners

There are two types of app install banners: <i>web</i> app install banners and <i>native</i> app install banners. They give you the ability to let users quickly and seamlessly add your web or native app to their home screens without leaving the browser.
