There are two types of app install banners: **web** app install banners and
[**native**](native-app-install) app install banners. They let users quickly and seamlessly add your web or native app to their home screens without leaving the browser.

Adding app install banners is easy; Chrome handles most of the heavy 
lifting for you. You need to include a web app manifest file in your site
with details about your app.

Chrome then uses a set of criteria and visit-frequency heuristics to determine
when to show the banner. Read on for more details.

### What are the criteria?

Chrome automatically displays the banner when your app meets the following
criteria:

* Has a [web app manifest](../web-app-manifest/) file with:
    - a `short_name` (used on the home screen)
    - a `name` (used in the banner)
    - a 144x144 png icon (the icon declarations must include a mime type of `image/png`)
    - a `start_url` that loads
* Has a [service worker](/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers)
  registered on your site.
* Is served over [HTTPS](/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https)
  (a requirement for using service worker).
* Is visited at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits.

### Testing the app install banner

The app install banner is only shown after the user visits the page at least
twice within five minutes. You can disable the visit-frequency check by enabling
the Chrome flag `#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks`. To test on desktop Chrome, you need to enable the Chrome flag `#enable-add-to-shelf`.  

Then, as long as you have a manifest (configured correctly), are on HTTPS (or `localhost`)
and have a service worker, you should see the install prompt.

## App install banner events

Chrome provides an easy mechanism to determine how the user responded to the
app install banner and even cancel or defer it until a more convenient time.

### Did a user install the app?

The `beforeinstallprompt` event returns a promise called `userChoice` 
that resolves when the user acts on the prompt.  The promise 
returns an object with a value of `dismissed` on the `outcome`
attribute or `accepted` if the user added the web page to the home screen.

    window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function(e) {
      // beforeinstallprompt Event fired
      
      // e.userChoice will return a Promise. 
      // For more details read: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/
      e.userChoice.then(function(choiceResult) {
        
        console.log(choiceResult.outcome);
        
        if(choiceResult.outcome == 'dismissed') {
          console.log('User cancelled home screen install');
        }
        else {
          console.log('User added to home screen');
        }
      });
    });
    

This is a good tool for understanding how your users interact with the app 
install prompt.


### Deferring or cancelling the prompt

Chrome manages when to trigger the prompt but for some sites this might not 
be ideal. You can defer the prompt to a later time in the app's usage or 
even cancel it. 

When Chrome decides to prompt the user to install the app you 
can prevent the default action and store the event for later. Then when 
the user has a positive interaction with your site you can then re-trigger 
the prompt by calling `prompt()` on the stored event. 

This causes Chrome to show the banner and all the Promise attributes 
such as `userChoice` will be available to bind to so that you can understand 
what action the user took.
    
    var deferredPrompt;
    
    window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function(e) {
      console.log('beforeinstallprompt Event fired');
      e.preventDefault();
      
      // Stash the event so it can be triggered later.
      deferredPrompt = e;
      
      return false;
    });
    
    btnSave.addEventListener('click', function() {
      if(deferredPrompt !== undefined) {
        // The user has had a postive interaction with our app and Chrome
        // has tried to prompt previously, so let's show the prompt.
        deferredPrompt.prompt();
      
        // Follow what the user has done with the prompt.
        deferredPrompt.userChoice.then(function(choiceResult) {
      
          console.log(choiceResult.outcome);
          
          if(choiceResult.outcome == 'dismissed') {
            console.log('User cancelled home screen install');
          }
          else {
            console.log('User added to home screen');
          }
          
          // We no longer need the prompt.  Clear it up.
          deferredPrompt = null;
        });
      }
    });
    

Alternatively, you can cancel the prompt by preventing the default.

    window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function(e) {
      console.log('beforeinstallprompt Event fired');
      e.preventDefault();
      return false;
    });
    
## Native app install banners

Native App install banners are similar to [Web app install banners](.), but
instead of adding to the home screen, they will let the user install your
native app without leaving your site.

### Criteria to show the banner

The criteria is similar to the Web App install banner except for the need of
a service worker. Your site must:

* Have a [web app manifest](../web-app-manifest/) file with:
  - a `short_name`
  - a `name` (used in the banner prompt)
  - a 144x144 png icon, your icon declaration's should include a mime type of `image/png`
  - a `related_applications` object with information about the app
* Be served over [HTTPS](/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/)
* Be visited by the user twice, over two separate days during the course
  of two weeks.

### Manifest requirements

To integrate into any manifest, add a `related_applications` array with the
platforms of `play` (for Google Play) and the App Id.


    "related_applications": [
      {
      "platform": "play",
      "id": "com.google.samples.apps.iosched"
      }
    ]
    

If just want to offer the user the ability to install your Android
application, and not show the web app install banner, then add
`"prefer_related_applications": true`. For example:


    "prefer_related_applications": true,
    "related_applications": [
      {
      "platform": "play",
      "id": "com.google.samples.apps.iosched"
      }
    ]
