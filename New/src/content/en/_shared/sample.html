<h2>Shared Includes</h2>
<p>
  The <code>include</code> tag includes another file or template at the location
  of the tag. If the file contains Django template directives, those directives
  will be interpolated.
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>
  Variables set by <code>setvar</code> prior to the include are in effect during
  the include. Variables set within the included file remain set in the outer
  file after the end of the include.
