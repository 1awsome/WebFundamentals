# Devsite Editing Wishlist

* [] **Set TOC Level** Some pages would tell a clearer story if the toc only contained level two. This is a tool, possibly command line, that would I could point at a single file or directory. I would also tell it what level I want the toc to go and it would edit the headings in the file or files.
* [] **Add Tags** This assumes a tagging feature much like what we currently have in /updates. It would pull the list of existing tags and let the auther choose tags to apply to a specific article.
* [] **Add See Also Links** 
* [] **Figure Numbering** Also a command line tool that I could point at a single file or directory to number figure captions.
